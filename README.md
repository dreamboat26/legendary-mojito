# Capstone Project on Machine Learning
## Overview

Welcome to the Capstone Project on Machine Learning - Recommendation System, as part of the IBM Coursera course. This repository contains the code and documentation for our final project, where we have applied machine learning techniques to build a recommendation system.

## Project Description
### Problem Statement

The primary objective of this research project is to enhance the overall learning experience for individuals by efficiently connecting them with courses that align with their interests and educational goals. Concurrently, we aim to analyze how increased interaction between learners and a wider array of courses through our recommender systems may positively impact the company's revenue.

At its current stage, the project is in the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, prioritizing a rigorous exploration and comparison of various machine learning models. The ultimate goal is to identify the model that exhibits superior performance in offline evaluations. This research endeavor is poised to contribute valuable insights and innovations to the field of personalized learning recommendations.

## Usage

The Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory provide step-by-step guidance on building and evaluating the recommendation system. You can follow these notebooks to understand the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation procedures.

Additionally, the code in the src directory can be adapted and extended to experiment with various recommendation algorithms and approaches, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization, or deep learning techniques.

## Results

The results of the recommendation system, including performance metrics, user feedback, and any visualizations, are documented in the project reports located in the reports directory. These reports summarize the project's findings and provide insights into the effectiveness of the recommendation system.

## Conclusion

This Capstone Project on Machine Learning - Recommendation System showcases our expertise in designing and implementing recommendation algorithms. By successfully completing this project, we have gained valuable experience in solving real-world recommendation problems, managing data pipelines, and evaluating the performance of recommendation systems.

I hope you find this project informative and inspiring for your own recommendation system endeavors. Feel free to explore the code and the pdf, adapt it to your specific use case, and use it as a reference for your future machine learning projects.
