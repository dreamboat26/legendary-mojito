# Capstone Project on Machine Learning
## Overview

Welcome to the Capstone Project on Machine Learning - Recommendation System, as part of the IBM Coursera course. This repository contains the code and documentation for our final project, where we have applied machine learning techniques to build a recommendation system.

## Project Description
### Problem Statement

The objective of this capstone project is to create an effective recommendation system for a specific domain or dataset. Recommendation systems are essential for enhancing user experiences, increasing engagement, and driving revenue in various industries, including e-commerce, entertainment, and content platforms.

## Usage

The Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory provide step-by-step guidance on building and evaluating the recommendation system. You can follow these notebooks to understand the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation procedures.

Additionally, the code in the src directory can be adapted and extended to experiment with various recommendation algorithms and approaches, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization, or deep learning techniques.

## Results

The results of the recommendation system, including performance metrics, user feedback, and any visualizations, are documented in the project reports located in the reports directory. These reports summarize the project's findings and provide insights into the effectiveness of the recommendation system.

## Conclusion

This Capstone Project on Machine Learning - Recommendation System showcases our expertise in designing and implementing recommendation algorithms. By successfully completing this project, we have gained valuable experience in solving real-world recommendation problems, managing data pipelines, and evaluating the performance of recommendation systems.

We hope you find this project informative and inspiring for your own recommendation system endeavors. Feel free to explore the code, adapt it to your specific use case, and use it as a reference for your future machine learning projects.
